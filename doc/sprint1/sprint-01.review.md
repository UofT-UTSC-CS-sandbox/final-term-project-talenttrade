## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * The decision to have everyone work on both the front and backend was successful. Most of the team hadn't work on backend before and some had little frontend experience so we at first thought splitting the members into front and back end teams would be good but instead chose to have everyone be fullstack developers. This led to everyone having a better understanding of the entire work process while learning front and back end at the same time.
 * The decision to have in person Scrum meetings on Tuesday was successful. We initially thought this wouldn't be any different to online meetings but being in person allowed us to more easily communicate and assist eachother with any problems we had. The first meeting we had where we planned what we were going to do for the sprint was very successful as we were able to easily engage in conversation and quickly bounce off eachother, resulting in a good plan.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * The descision (or more accurately the lack of a decision) to not specifically detail who was working on what led to some early confusion and miscommunication. In our planning meeting we had decided on who was going to work on what but failed to make decisions on who would do what when some members had some overlap in jobs. This led to confusion where some members didn't implement something because they thought the other would do it, or implement something in a way that the other didn't account for in their code.
 * The decision to work on the system design document later in the sprint. We thought that it would be fine to leave it to work on after we finished all the coding we had to do but we are now left having to do the document last minute. 


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Discuss our jobs in more detail. By communicating more with the team early in the sprint process this should help prevent confusion between members who have overlap in their jobs. This would result in our work being more efficient and allow us to not spend additional time changing code to fit other's needs.
 * Work on documentation earlier in the process. By working on documentation earlier, this will prevent it from being done last minute which will help prevent any errors and potentially help other members in cases where the documentation would be useful.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Post management. Refer to frontend/src/pages and backend/posts for front and back code respectively.
 * Home page/features posts. Refer to frontend/src/pages and frontend/src/components and backend/posts for front and back end code respectively.
 * User management. Refer to frontend/src/pages and backend/accounts for front and back code respectively.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * There are no goals that were planned that were not completed.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
