# Talent Trade Release Planning

## Release Goal
The goal for the release is to have the TalentTrade website completely operational. Users can sign up and log into their accounts to access the full features of the website. Non-users can view limited pages of the website but cannot use features of the website, like create post. Users have a profile where they can detail their expreience to other users, along with showing a rating and review of this user. Posts can be searched for and filtered based on a variety of categories such as location and rating. Post authors can see who has applied to their job and message them before setting their post as inactive.
