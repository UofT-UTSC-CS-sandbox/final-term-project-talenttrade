## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 5
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * The decision to have 2 people work on the searching and filtering user stories was a good idea. This sprint had 3 main areas of work and we thought that searching and filtering would be the most difficult, and we were correct in this assumption. Having 2 people working on these user stories allowed that area of the sprint to not fall behind the others.
 * The dicision to use Jira more helped organize our work more. In the first sprint we didn't use Jira that much because none of us had much experience using it. Now that were are more familiar with it, we were more active with updating statuses of user stories and creating child tasks, which enabled us to more easily tell what is and isn't done and provide help when needed.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * As mentioned above, we had 2 people working in the searching and filtering user stories, which was a good idea. What we didn't realize was that both people working on it had an exam the day after this sprint was due, leading to them having to juggle more work near the end of the sprint, along with the user stories being a little more work than we thought. 
 * In order to use location data for the user, we found an API that we thought was good and planned to use it but it turned out to not be as good as we hoped, resulting in time wasted learning and integrating this API.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ensure that we do not assign more work to someone based on their schedule availability. 
 * Do more research on any external tools or API we plan to user before actually using them.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Searching and filtering. Refer to frontend/src/pages, frontend/src/components and backend/accounts, backend/posts for front and back code respectively.
 * User profile. Refer to frontend/src/pages and backend/accounts, backend/worldcities for front and back end code respectively.
 * Ratings and reviews. Refer to frontend/src/components and backend/ratings, backend/reviews for front and back code respectively.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Scrum-21: incomplete due to time constraints
 * Scrum-11: incomplete due to time constraints
 * Scrum-59: incomplete due to time constraints

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

 * Better communication on how certain features are implemented. As we get further towards the end of the project there will be more interaction between features that are already implemented and not yet implemented so having good communication is crucial.
 * Complete left over user stories from this sprint as soon as possible. We don't want to be weighed down by these stories being incomplete, which could effect the other work we have to do.
