#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

TalentTrade is a marketplace web app designed for individuals with various skills and trades to connect and exchange their services.

It solves the following problems:
 * High cost of services
    * Problem: Many people find it expensive to hire professionals for various services, which can be a barrier to access.
    * Solution: TalentTrade allows users to trade their services instead of paying with money, making it a cost-effective way to obtain needed services.
 * Underutilized skills:
    * Problem: Skilled individuals often have talents that are underutilized, either because they lack opportunities to showcase them or because they can't find clients.
    * Solution: TalentTrade provides a platform for users to showcase their skills.
 * Time wasted searching for service providors:
    * Problem: Many individuals waste time/effort searching for services or clients through traditional methods, which can be inefficient and frustrating.
    * Solution: TalentTrade uses a matchmaking algorithm that considers geographical location, along with a rating system, it makes it easier for users to find local matches for service exchanges.

The overall flow/user experience of TalentTrade will be similar to existing marketplace apps such as Kijiji and Fiverr.

Two key feautures of our platform are verification and the matchmaking algorithm.

 * Verification and trust: To build trust within the community, we implement a verification system, consisting of user reviews and ratings.
 * Matchmaking algorithm: We developed an algorithm to efficiently match users based on their skills, needs, and location.

### Highlights

AMMENDEMENT 0:

A group member voiced that we should not restrict users to have to trade their skill for someone else's, but that there should be an option to recieve service in exchange for money. Though what differentiates our platform is the ability to exchange skills, having this as an option is easy to do. It can only benefit the platform as long as the main focus/emphasis of the product is still on trading skills.
We discussed this and came to this conclusion during an in-person meeting.
