#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 * Short (2-5 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.
TalentTrade is a marketplace web app designed for individuals with various skills and trades to connect and exchange their services.

It solves the following problems:
 * High cost of services
    * Problem: Many people find it expensive to hire professionals for various services, which can be a barrier to access.
    * Solution: TalentTrade allows users to trade their services instead of paying with money, making it a cost-effective way to obtain needed services.
 * Underutilized skills:
    * Problem: Skilled individuals often have talents that are underutilized, either because they lack opportunities to showcase them or because they can't find clients.
    * Solution: TalentTrade provides a platform for users to showcase their skills.
 * Time wasted searching for service providors:
    * Problem: Many individuals waste time/effort searching for services or clients through traditional methods, which can be inefficient and frustrating.
    * Solution: TalentTrade uses a matchmaking algorithm that considers geographical location, along with a rating system, it makes it easier for users to find local matches for service exchanges.

The overall flow/user experience of TalentTrade will be similar to existing marketplace apps such as Kijiji.

Two key feautures of our platform are verification and the matchmaking algorithm.

 * Verification and trust: To build trust within the community, we implement a verification system, consisting of user reviews and ratings.
 * Matchmaking algorithm: We developed an algorithm to efficiently match users based on their skills, needs, and geographical location.
