## Iteration 3 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 19
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * The decision to only allow logged in users to see the majority of our website was a good decision. This simplified much of our code by allowing us to assume that anyone accessing these parts of the website were already logged in.
 * The decision to change how we wanted to do the chat halfway through the sprint was a good decision. This allowed the chat to be worked on instead of continuing to attempt implementing it in a way that was causing problems. Without this change the main chat features might not have been completed for this sprint. 


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * The decision to not do early research on how chat is implemented resulted in difficulties and confusion on how to implement it. This delayed the implementation of the chat which resulted in user stories that relied on it not being implemented.
 * The decision to not discuss the reccomendation algorithm in depth resulted in disagreements about how it should be implemented. This added unneeded friction between group members but we were able to create a version that all members agreed with. 


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Have 2 people work on finishing the chat related user stories so that the chat can catch up to the rest of the project.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * Unfinished Sprint 2 backlog: Refer to frontend/src/pages for front end code.
 * User Chat: Refer to frontend/src/pages and backend/chat for front and back end code respectively.
 * Reccomendation Algorithm: Refer to frontend/src/pages and backend/backend for front and back end code respectively.
 * Update Frontend Visuals: Refer to frontend/src/pages and frontend/src/components for front and back end code respectively.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Scrum-2, 9, 24, 25: incomplete due to reliance of chat being completed

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
