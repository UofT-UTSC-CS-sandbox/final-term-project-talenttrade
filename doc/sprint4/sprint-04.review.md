## Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 31
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * The decision to focus on completing the remaining user stories in the first week of the sprint was a good decision. This allowed us additional time to make sure everything worked and gave us more time to work on A2.
 * The decision to have everyone work on small additions to features they already worked on was a good decision. This made the implementation much quicker as everyone was already working with code they were familiar with. This helped the above decision too.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * The decision to attempt to implement additional features was unsuccessful. We initially thought we would be able to add more complicated features to this sprint but quickly realised that these features were too time consuming and decided to go with simpler features.
 * We feel like there are no other unsuccessful decisions this sprint. We feel like we've learned from our mistakes and have gotten better at making process dicisions.

 * None (end of project)
