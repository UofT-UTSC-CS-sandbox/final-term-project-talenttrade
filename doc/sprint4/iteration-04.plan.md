#### Artifacts

* Jira tickets for each subtask in each story (e.g. backend, DB model, frontend) Teammates will assign tickets to themselves on Jira

#### Git / GitHub workflow

After completing a feature, we create a pull request from the feature branch to the dev branch. Someone else will review the code. If there are merge conflicts, they will leave a comment for the person who made the pull request and have them fix the conflicts. The person who made the pull request is responsible for the merging. We chose this workflow because the person who worked on the feature understands it the best so they should be the one to make any of the changes that are required. Outside of someone else reviewing the code, the feature branch is entirely managed by the person working on that feature.

We will continue to use the same naming convention for feature branches (feature-___ ).
